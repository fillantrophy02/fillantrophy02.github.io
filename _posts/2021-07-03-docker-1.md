### What is Docker?

1. **Docker** runs **processes** in isolated containers.
2. A **process** running on a host (local/remote) is called a **container**.
3. A **container** has its own file system, networking & isolated process tree.
4. The file used to build a **container** is called an **image**.
5. An **image** acts as a set of instructions/a type of template.

### Docker commands
